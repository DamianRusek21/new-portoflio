# AWS Services

This document outlines the AWS services used in the
bjornmelin-platform-io platform.

## Core Services

### AWS CDK

Used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to define and provision AWS
infrastructure. Our CDK stacks live in `infrastructure/lib/stacks/`:

- **DNS Stack** (`dns-stack.ts`): Manages DNS configuration
- **Email Stack** (`email-stack.ts`): Configures email delivery via Resend
- **Monitoring Stack** (`monitoring-stack.ts`): Sets up monitoring and alerts
- **Storage Stack** (`storage-stack.ts`): Manages storage resources
- **Deployment Stack** (`deployment-stack.ts`): Handles deployment configuration

### Email Delivery (Resend)

- Used for sending contact form emails
- Configuration managed through the Email Stack
- API key stored in AWS SSM Parameter Store
- Implementation in `src/lib/email/`

## Infrastructure Organization

The infrastructure code is organized as follows:

```text
infrastructure/
├── bin/
│   └── app.ts                 # CDK app entry point
├── lib/
│   ├── constants.ts           # Shared constants
│   ├── functions/             # Lambda functions
│   │   └── contact-form/      # Contact form handler (uses Resend)
│   ├── stacks/               # CDK stack definitions
│   └── types/                # TypeScript types
└── cdk.json                  # CDK configuration
```

## Environment Configuration

Environment-specific configurations are managed through:

- GitHub Environment `production` variables for public client config
- AWS SSM Parameter Store / Secrets Manager for server-only values
- `infrastructure/cdk.json` for CDK app configuration and CDK context
- IAM OIDC + region for AWS credentials (no long-lived keys)

### Reading SSM Parameters (Node.js)

For Lambda/back-end code, prefer fetching configuration at startup from SSM:

```ts
// Usage example in Lambda functions (infrastructure/lib/functions/contact-form/index.ts)
// Uses relative import from the Lambda handler location:
import { getParameter } from "../../utils/ssm";

// Fetch decrypted secrets at runtime:
const contactEmail = await getParameter("/portfolio/prod/CONTACT_EMAIL", true);
const resendApiKey = await getParameter("/portfolio/prod/resend/api-key", true);
```

## Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring is configured through the monitoring stack, which sets up:

- CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Log groups for application logs
- Infrastructure health monitoring

## Security

Infrastructure security is implemented through:

- IAM roles and policies defined in stack configurations
- Resource access controls
- Environment-based security groups
