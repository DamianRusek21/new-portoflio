## Context

The Projects page must work under strict static export (`output: "export"`) and deploy to S3/CloudFront.
All Projects data must be available at build time and must remain stable, typed, and testable.

Historically, the repo used a hand-curated `src/data/projects.ts` array and a generated JSON under `docs/`.
We need a single canonical source that:

- Is safe for static export (no runtime fetching).
- Has a validation boundary (Zod) to protect the UI from generator changes.
- Supports light curation without editing the generated file.
- Produces a lean view model to avoid shipping unnecessary data into Client Components.

## Decision

We adopt a canonical Projects content pipeline:

- Canonical dataset lives at `src/content/projects/projects.generated.json` (generated; not edited by hand).
- A curated overrides layer lives at `src/content/projects/overrides.ts` (presentation only).
- The generated JSON is validated at the boundary with Zod (`src/lib/schemas/github-projects.ts`).
- A normalized view model is produced in `src/data/projects.ts` and exported for UI consumption.

## Alternatives considered

- Keep canonical data under `docs/` and import it from there.
- Convert the generated JSON to a TypeScript module exporting constants.
- Put the JSON in `public/` and fetch client-side.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Static-export safe: all data is bundled at build time.
- Safer evolution: generator can add fields without breaking runtime, thanks to `z.looseObject()` and `.catchall(z.unknown())`.
- Faster UI iteration: presentation changes do not require editing the generated file.
- Smaller client payload: Client Components receive a pre-normalized model with only needed fields.

### Trade-offs

- Requires keeping overrides keyed by stable project `id`.
- Any schema-breaking generator changes fail fast at build/test time.
