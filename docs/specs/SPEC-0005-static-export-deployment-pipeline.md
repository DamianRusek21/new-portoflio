## Summary

This spec defines the required production deployment sequence for a strict static export hosted on
S3/CloudFront with a CSP hash allow-list for Next.js inline scripts.

## Context

Static export artifacts and CSP hashes must remain in sync to avoid production CSP failures.

## Goals / Non-goals

### Goals

- Define the authoritative deploy sequence for production.
- Ensure CSP hashes always match the published `out/` artifacts.
- Provide a break-glass manual deploy procedure.

### Non-goals

- Redesigning the deployment platform or hosting model.

## Requirements

Requirement IDs are defined in `docs/specs/requirements.md`.

### Functional requirements

- **FR-501:** Production deploys are fully automated via GitHub Actions.

### Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-501:** CSP headers and static export artifacts never drift.

## Constraints

- Deployment must remain compatible with static export (`output: "export"`).
- CSP hashes are generated from the `out/` HTML output.

## Decision Framework Score (must be ≥ 9.0)

| Criterion | Weight | Score | Weighted |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solution leverage | 0.35 | 9.1 | 3.19 |
| Application value | 0.30 | 9.3 | 2.79 |
| Maintenance & cognitive load | 0.25 | 9.0 | 2.25 |
| Architectural adaptability | 0.10 | 8.9 | 0.89 |

**Total:** 9.12 / 10.0

## Design

### Production pipeline (authoritative)

Production deploys are performed by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) on merges to
`main` (docs-only changes are ignored by that workflow).

The workflow sequence is:

1. `pnpm build`
2. `pnpm -C infrastructure cdk deploy prod-portfolio-storage`
3. `pnpm deploy:static:prod` (S3 upload + CSP hashes KVS sync + CloudFront invalidation)

### Why ordering matters

The CloudFront `Content-Security-Policy` includes a script hash allow-list generated from the
static export HTML output. Deploying CSP configuration (CloudFront Function + KVS wiring) without uploading the
matching `out/` artifacts can cause a blank page due to CSP violations (ADR-0001).

## Acceptance criteria

- `pnpm build` produces:
  - `out/` containing fully static HTML/CSS/JS/assets
  - updated `infrastructure/lib/generated/next-inline-script-hashes.ts`
  - updated `infrastructure/lib/generated/next-inline-script-hashes.kvs.json`
  - updated `infrastructure/lib/functions/cloudfront/next-csp-response.js`
- `deploy.yml` deploys the matching `out/` directory, syncs the CSP hashes KVS, and invalidates CloudFront.
- Post-deploy smoke check passes (`curl $NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` returns 2xx/3xx).

## Testing

- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm -C infrastructure test`

## Operational notes

### Manual deployment (break-glass)

Manual deployments must follow:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm -C infrastructure deploy:storage
pnpm deploy:static:prod
```

### Operational guardrails

- Never manually edit `infrastructure/lib/generated/next-inline-script-hashes.ts`.
- Do not deploy `prod-portfolio-storage` without a preceding successful build from the same commit.
- If `deploy.yml` is skipped (docs-only changes), use `manual-deploy.yml` when a site deploy is
  intentionally required.

## Failure modes and mitigation

- CSP/hash mismatch → follow the authoritative pipeline and redeploy `out/` + KVS in order.

## Key files

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `scripts/generate-next-inline-csp-hashes.mjs`
- `scripts/deploy-static-site.mjs`
- `infrastructure/lib/stacks/storage-stack.ts`
